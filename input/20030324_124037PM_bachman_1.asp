Over the past 18 months, the University has been moving forward with replacing its 1970's-era student information system (SIS) with a much-improved and more powerful version based on PeopleSoft. The new student system, "Towson Online Services", will allow you to accomplish many of the things you previously did using TSiNET, plus much more. Additionally, Towson Online Services offers extended hours of availability. <BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI>TSiNET will still be available for several months for 
  Spring 2003 grades, account balances, payments and prior year Financial Aid<BR>
<LI>To enter Towson Online Services, click on the Online 
  Services tab at the top of the "Students@Towson" main page. You 
  MUST have an active Tiger account to use Towson Online Services; if you do 
  not, or you need to reset your Tiger password, the Online Services login page 
  has links to help you get started.<BR>
<LI>On March 19, all students were sent a personalized letter explaining how to get started; the letter included their Tiger account username, their new TU ID, and other important information. <A href="http://wwwnew.towson.edu/applications/dailydigestpeoplesoft/databases/news/LetterToStudents.htm">You can find a copy of that letter here.</A><BR>
<LI>Over 3 million student records were converted from the old system; as you explore your own student records, if you find any errors or missing data, please email <A href="mailto:registration@towson.edu">registration@towson.edu</A><BR>

Students@Towson will continue to evolve to meet your needs, and your ideas are essential. Please feel free to contribute your comments, suggestions, or critiques using the Feedback link at the bottom of this page, or in Feedback under Hot Topics.<BR>
