TOWSON HILLEL WELCOMES A NEW DIRECTOR<BR>
Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan has joined Towson University as the Director of<BR>
Towson Hillel.  Located in the Jewish Cultural Center in Newell<BR>
Dining Hall, Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, is dedicated to bringing meaningful and celebratory Jewish experiences to all members of the university community.  Rabbi Kaplan comes with broad experience in Jewish engagement work as well as familiarity with campus life.  Graduating with Brandeis University's class of '85, Rabbi Kaplan then went on to a series of volunteer positions in Israel.  He then spent several years in leading rabbinic seminaries in Jerusalem where he was ordained at Yeshiva Aish HaTorah in 1995.  He joins us most recently from his position in Washington DC where he ran programming for Jewish young professionals.  Rabbi Kaplan and his wife Leah have two children and have recently moved to the Baltimore area.<BR>
He can be reached on campus at 704-4671 or at akaplan@towson.edu.<BR>
We wish him much success!<BR>
