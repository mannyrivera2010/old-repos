To all Digest recipients,<BR>
<BR>
These issues of the Digest you are now seeing in your Inbox, are for testing purposes only, and are not indicative of the Digest being sent out to the campus community.<BR>
<BR>
As an editor or contributor, you have been selected to receive the Digest as it runs on a daily basis to see how the sample content you are posting will look when the Digest actually goes "live".<BR>
<BR>
Please send your comments and suggestions to me, Ray Cardillo at <A HREF='mailto:cardillo@towson.edu'>cardillo@towson.edu</A><BR>
as you continue to work with the editor and test your postings.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
<BR>
Ray
