<HEAD><TITLE>Health Insurance Waiver Requirement</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
All Towson students were mailed a health insurance packet with an application for the 2003-2004 plan. This is a plan sponsored by the university for Towson students. The information in the packet refers to the need to file a waiver if you have your own insurance policy.  This waiver requirement applies only to international students as indicated below:<BR>
<BR>
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ON F OR J VISAS: All International students on J and F visas are automatically enrolled in the Towson-sponsored insurance plan and billed for the insurance on their bursar account UNLESS they file a waiver application showing proof of alternative insurance that meets the university's minimum standards by September 15. (For more information, click here: <A HREF='http://wwwnew.towson.edu/dowellhealthcenter/intlpolicy.html'>http://wwwnew.towson.edu/dowellhealthcenter/intlpolicy.html</A>)<BR>
<BR>
FOR ALL OTHER STUDENTS (i.e. U.S. citizens and permanent residents): YOU DO NOT NEED TO FILE A WAIVER APPLICATION. This is a VOLUNTARY insurance plan for U.S. citizens and permanent residents, so no waiver application is necessary. Please note: You are eligible to purchase the insurance if you are taking 6 or more credits and need health insurance. We strongly recommend you consider this plan if:<BR>
a. You have no insurance<BR>
b. Your insurance is an out-of-state managed care plan with a PPO requirement or an HMO.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for the confusion. <BR>
